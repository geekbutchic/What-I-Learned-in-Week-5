## What is Mapping? 
* They always produce a new array 
* They have the same number of elements as the original 
* Each element has been changed in some way

## What is a Filter? 
* Only .push some variables into our new array.
* Only pushing the one's that match our criteria .filter.
* What's in the for loop is what the difference that get's pushed into the new array.
* What's our criteria in the *if* statement, decides what goes in the element.

## For-of Loops what are they?
* So far we have been using [i] to access the value.
* Now we are able to use a loop access without hitting [i].
* More efficient and less syntax.

## Objects tell us more?

* Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
* List about one thing.  For example **Classic Car** and the criteria that define a **Classic Car**.
* These are called values.
* We can also reassign those properties.
* Changing an existing property and makking a new one.
  
## Objects with Mutations?  I'm listening...

* Objects are mutable in JavaScript.
* Objects are reference typed data. Therefore, they contains the reference to the value.
* Once we change that reference point, that's it we have mutated the code.
* Mutation is a bad programming practice. If your code is mutable, you might change or break something without knowing. The code becomes harder to read and test, produces non-predictable side effects.
* Is there a better way?  Sure is!

## Objects without Mutations, the right way.

* Objects without mutations we are able to change the value without losing the reference value.
* We essentially are returning a new version.
* But still able to keep the reference value.
* Anything we pass in can be changed but still allow to keep that reference value.  
* It's a great way to change a value but always know you'll have that reference value to return too.

* On to Week-6 ðŸ¥³
